        		<h3>Gen Ed</h3>
                <p>
                        The gen ed courses I took were econ 101, psych 383, and psych 280. These courses didn’t really affect my engineering education, but they helped make me a more wholistic student. My social psychology course (psych 280) gave me insight to how we as humans work, how best we interact with each other, and how to understand social interactions. This may not have furthered my technical engineering skills, but it did help me understand how to act as a professional in the workplace.
                        My short term goal is to graduate with a degree in software engineering. My long term goal however is to get to a place where I feel that my skills are valuable and that I have used them to create something I find meaningful and that I am proud of. Right now, I feel that my skills have been used to create a few projects, however, I’d like to get to a place where I feel that I’ve impacted/reached more people than I have now. My ideal career in engineering would be somewhere that I feel I am making a difference and have the ability to apply my creative skills to my work. I am very passionate about helping people and working with people closely, so I hope that whatever I end up doing allows me to do that.
                        I think my gen ed courses didn’t really help in evaluating engineering solutions in problem solving in a technical aspect. Most of my gen ed classes were in the arts and humanities, so they didn’t focus on subjects such as math or engineering. However, in terms of how those classes helped me to think about an engineering problem, I think they taught me how to think about helping people in general. After all, that’s what engineering is about. We build things to better the world. My psychology courses and econ courses taught me valuable skills in areas that were not technical, but still valuable to being a good engineer. 
                         Classes such as econ 101 really helped me understand engineering on a wider, global context. To be able to engineer a product, you have to understand the consumer, and you have to understand the market. Econ 101 wrapped all those things into one and also included important business topics such as supply and demand. All of these things are pertinent to being a well-rounded engineer. My psychology courses helped me further my knowledge in the societal context by providing me with important background information on how we work as humans.

                <h3>Ethics Essay</h3>
                <p>
                        Assuming that as a software developer in the Theranos project that I was fully aware of the fraud happening, I would have quit immediately. Then, I would have contacted someone with more authority than I to conduct an investigation into Theranos so that they may take legal action on the company. What Elizabeth Holmes did was incredibly wrong, so I would have never stayed on the project if I knew what was truly going on. For me, ethics and morality are a huge part of my life. I try to live an ethically moral life because I care about people and helping them live better lives. Theranos only made people’s lives worse by deceiving them and giving people false hope.
                        For the engineers and managers that did stay on the project, I think the answer is pretty obvious as to why they did what they did. Money. Power. That is the essence of what Elizabeth Holmes wanted, and I assume that that is what the people on the project wanted as well. They assumed they would never get caught, and so they stayed on. In addition, I think that some engineers were perhaps too afraid to speak up. They probably didn’t have much power in the company and so maybe they were afraid that they themselves would be thrown under the bus if they spoke out and would get into legal trouble. Lastly, people tend to do what they’re told. Perhaps, because of the authority they were under, the engineers felt that they had no other choice. It’s possible some of the were just doing what they were told and truly had no idea that what they were doing was wrong.

                <h3>Cumaltive Reflection</h3>
				<p>
                        Iowa State has given me the tools I need to enable myself to succeed as an engineer in the workplace through its various classes, events such as hackathons, and clubs such as Digital Women. However, most of the skills that I learned were due to my own personal efforts, as I believe a lot of the later classes in the software engineering curriculum because less and less pertinent to what I wanted to do in the workplace; instead, I had to focus on finding and learning skills that I believed were valuable to my future on my own. 
                        Firstly, beginning with design systems. I think the only class that really focused on design systems was Com S 309. Even then, we were sort of expected to already know what system architectures and designs were. In fact, in almost all of my classes, system architecture and design was treated as “common knowledge.” In this way, I don’t think ISU really prepared me for this, as it was something we were already expected to know, which became frustrating for me as a beginner. 
                        In terms of formulating and solving engineering problems and thinking about our solutions in a global/societal context, while also considering ethical implications, I believe ISU prepared me fairly well for these scenarios. In almost all of our classes, we are expected to keep our users close in mind. In this way, we were able to think about how our solutions actually impacted people. This ties in of course to ethics and helps us to practice solving problems while considering global and societal impacts. 
                    Almost all of my classes include some kind of group project, so I had lots of practice working with a diverse group of people. However, this wasn’t something particular to ISU, as this is something I think everyone has had to do since even our younger years in school. Personally, I’ve made the effort to get to know all my team members and take on more of a leadership role in group projects, which I think has helped me become more confident as a group member to prepare me for future group work.
                    I’ve also spent some time keeping up with current events by following things such as tech blogs/news websites, which has helped me keep up with contemporary issues in today’s world. This has also helped me understand professional and ethical responsibilities because while keeping up with the issues, I was able to think and brainstorm about what I would do to solve those issues if I were tasked with doing so. I don’t believe you can be a well-rounded engineer without keeping up with current events, so I believe this has helped me tremendously in understanding professional responsibilities. 
                    In almost all of my classes that include some sort of difficult project, I drew help from other students and the internet. I find that putting heads together always helped to not only find a solution faster, but to better understand the solution. I always enjoy having someone explain a concept to me, especially if they are an expert on the matter. Sometimes, it’s easier to have a student explain concepts because they can relate to you in a way that a professor can’t. Especially considering that most professors would have been studying the subject they are teaching for perhaps decades, this makes it more difficult to explain such topics to students who are just now learning it. This is why I have always found it easier to ask my peers questions because they can explain concepts to me in a way that I can personally understand. Other than that, I find that looking up tutorials and YouTube videos is extremely helpful. Again, I think having someone else explain the problem aside from a professor gives a new perspective that can help better your understanding, so this is always what I turned to. 
                    
                    
                    Joining clubs, especially clubs like Digital Women helped me tremendously in my growth as a student. Not only did I get to meet students in my classes who I perhaps would not have gotten to meet before, but I got to participate in events such as workshops and hackathons. Hackathons helped me gain experience because they forced me to learn a new skill in a short amount of time, a skill which I probably wouldn’t have the motivation to do without the pressures of a time deadline. Because of my participation in Digital Women, I was able to not only participate in hackathons like this, but I was able to also help coordinate and organize these events. 
                    I’ve recently learned to use documentation much more in order to apply new skills or knowledge to new problems, which has helped me gain confidence in taking risks. I used to just try to dive right into a new language or tool and try to figure it out as I went along, but I’ve learned to use resources such as documentation a lot more now. This has helped me gain a better understanding of new tools, which has given me the confidence to apply my new knowledge to develop things that I perhaps wouldn’t have had the confidence to develop before. 
                    I think if I were to repeat my undergraduate years, I would focus less on grades. Because I was so caught up in getting good grades, I adopted learning strategies that ultimately didn’t really help me. Memorizing things on repeat before an exam or even just memorizing things in general from lecture notes to apply to homeworks didn’t really help me learn. In fact, I barely remember anything from my early calculus classes or other classes that required a lot of memorization. I think that if I had been less focused on getting a good grade, I would have tried to learn without being worried about making a mistake. In this way, I could have learned from my mistakes and also tried to just learn without worrying about the outcome. I think because I was so caught up on getting a good grade, I ended up just learning to get the grade, and then forgot all the information after. I wish that classes focused less on test grades and instead gave students more opportunity to fail, so that we wouldn’t be so afraid of failure.
